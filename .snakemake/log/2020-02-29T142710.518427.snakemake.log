MissingOutputException in line 59 of /Users/jenniferblanc/infer_mutational_bias/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
output/GWAS_ATLAD/clumped/CKD_4210.log
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job LD_clump_GWAS_ATLAS since they might be corrupted:
output/GWAS_ATLAS/clumped/CKD_4210.clumped
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
