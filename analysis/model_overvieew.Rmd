## Set-up 

In this document, I am going to outline the whole polygenic mutation selection balance model. These notes are based on the explanation Jeremy gave on 11/27. First, I will outline the general set-up and then I will go through how to solve different parts of the model. 

This model is based on the liability threshold model where every individual has a liability for the disease, $Z_i$, that is the sum of their genetic libability, $G_i$ and their libability due to the environment, $E_i$.  

$$Z_i = G_i + E_i \;\;\;\;\; E_i\sim N(0, V_e)$$  

The genetic component of liability can be further decomposed into the sum of an the number of liability increasing alleles at a site multiplied by the effect size of the liability increasing allele. For now we assume there is some distribution from which effect sizes are drawn, $p(\alpha)$.  

$$G_i = \sum_{l=1}^{L} \alpha_l *g_{i,l} \;\;\;\;\;\;\;\; g_{i,l} \subset \{0,1,2\}$$  

Both genetic and environmental liability are normally distributed, meaning that the overall liability is also normally distributed. In the threshold model, there is a threshold beyond which individuals have the disease and have reduced fitness as a consequence. Specifically individuals who are beyond the threshold have fitness $1-S$.
**Check: is S the reduction in relative fitness for everyone who is across the threshold? Mean reduction in offspring?**
